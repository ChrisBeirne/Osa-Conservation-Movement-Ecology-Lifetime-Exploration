This page shows this process for each mammal within the project. It has been automated so that we always have access to a stardardised and cleaned locations database. 3.0.1 Tapirs For the tapir collars we use the Telonics - TGW-4577-4 model, wioth data sent through the Iridium system. They have low voltage and mortality alerts. There are two types of location data these collars collect - regular GPS and QFP. QFP’s are Quick Fix Positions and use less battery than a standard GPS fix. Units can be configured to collect GPS, QFP, or a mix of the two location types - we collect a mix. Our collars collect QFP’s when there is no GPS signal available. Succeded = a successful GPS location Resolved QFP = a successful QFP location Resolved QFP = an uncertain QFP location (lower quality) Unresolved QFP = A poor quality QFP Lets explore the implications of these different fix types for one individual - Juancito. 3.0.1.1 Juancito To date we have 4011 fixes from Juancito. Of those, they are of the following types.

So there is unreliability in all of the QFP estimates, but the GPS look great (not much spread). Lets explore the error around each type of fix (if it has an estimate present): Only GPS data has an error in meters (max 127m): QFP data has error in doplar estimates: So we have a huge spread in error. Lets subset to anything with a hdop &lt;10,and resolved. This substantially reduced the spread but still leaves a couple of issues - notable outliers. We should also use ctmm (as in the vultures) to find errors: 3.0.1.2 Tuva To date we have 1581 fixes from Tuva. Of those, they are of the following types. Var1 Freq Percentage Resolved QFP 839 0.53 Resolved QFP (Uncertain) 37 0.02 Succeeded 195 0.12 Unresolved QFP 510 0.32 Which means even less “resolved” locations.
