"],["tapirs.html", "3.1 Tapirs", " 3.1 Tapirs For the tapir collars we use the Telonics - TGW-4577-4 model, wioth data sent through the Iridium system. They have low voltage and mortality alerts. There are two types of location data these collars collect - regular GPS and QFP. QFP’s are Quick Fix Positions and use less battery than a standard GPS fix. Units can be configured to collect GPS, QFP, or a mix of the two location types - we collect a mix. Our collars collect QFP’s when there is no GPS signal available. Succeded = a successful GPS location Resolved QFP = a successful QFP location Resolved QFP = an uncertain QFP location (lower quality) Unresolved QFP = A poor quality QFP Lets explore the implications of these different fix types for one individual - Juancito. 3.1.1 Juancito (CR) ## Reading layer `OC_trails2&#39; from data source ## `/Users/runner/work/Osa-Conservation-Movement-Ecology-Lifetime-Exploration/Osa-Conservation-Movement-Ecology-Lifetime-Exploration/shapefiles/OC_trails2.shp&#39; ## using driver `ESRI Shapefile&#39; ## Simple feature collection with 204 features and 1 field ## Geometry type: MULTILINESTRING ## Dimension: XY ## Bounding box: xmin: -83.35712 ymin: 8.393359 xmax: -83.30851 ymax: 8.429462 ## Geodetic CRS: WGS 84 ## Reading layer `shipetiari_trails&#39; from data source ## `/Users/runner/work/Osa-Conservation-Movement-Ecology-Lifetime-Exploration/Osa-Conservation-Movement-Ecology-Lifetime-Exploration/shapefiles/shipetiari_trails.shp&#39; ## using driver `ESRI Shapefile&#39; ## Simple feature collection with 9 features and 15 fields ## Geometry type: LINESTRING ## Dimension: XYZ ## Bounding box: xmin: -71.17661 ymin: -12.50235 xmax: -71.16064 ymax: -12.47421 ## z_range: zmin: 309 zmax: 399.5 ## Geodetic CRS: WGS 84 First observation: 2022-05-29 18:01:25 Last observation: 2023-11-09 04:02:20 Active for: 528.4 days To date we have 4011 fixes from Juancito.
